# Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Options

### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Easiest)
1. Click the "Deploy" button in the Replit interface
2. Your app will be automatically deployed with a `.replit.app` domain
3. No additional configuration needed

### Option 2: Vercel (Recommended)
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel` in your project directory
3. Follow the prompts to deploy
4. Your app will be live at a `vercel.app` domain

### Option 3: Netlify
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

### Option 4: Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will auto-detect and deploy your app
3. Set environment variables if needed

## Environment Variables

For production deployment, you may want to set:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

## Build Process

The project uses Vite for building:
- Frontend and backend are bundled together
- Static assets are optimized
- TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript
- CSS is minified and optimized

## Production Considerations

Before deploying to production:

1. **Database**: Replace in-memory storage with a real database (PostgreSQL recommended)
2. **Authentication**: Add user registration and login
3. **Payment Processing**: Integrate with Stripe, PayPal, or similar
4. **Security**: Add HTTPS, CORS configuration, rate limiting
5. **Monitoring**: Add error tracking and analytics
6. **Email**: Set up email notifications for orders
7. **Backup**: Implement data backup strategies

## Performance Optimization

- Images are optimized and served from CDN (Unsplash)
- CSS is minified and tree-shaken
- JavaScript is bundled and compressed
- React Query provides efficient caching
- Lazy loading for improved performance
